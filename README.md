# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a minor project for disease prediction using machine learning classifiers such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron). The project focuses on evaluating the performance of these classifiers based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the following files:
- [training_data.csv](training_data.csv)
- [test_data.csv](test_data.csv)

You can replace it with your own dataset. Ensure that the dataset is in the CSV format.

## Classifiers
The following classifiers are implemented in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)

## Results
After running the main script, the following results are generated:
- Accuracy of each classifier
- Confusion matrices
- Classification reports

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Ensure that your dataset is in the CSV format and replace the provided datasets (`training_data.csv` and `testing.csv`) with your own dataset if needed.

## Usage

After installing the project, you can use it as follows:

1. Run the main script to train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
2. Examine the generated results, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports, to assess the performance of each classifier.
